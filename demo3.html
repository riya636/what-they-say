            "Since its foundation in 2013, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women has never ceased to strive for excellence. The university's motto - "Aapo Deepo Bhava" has been the guiding philosophy behind all our collective endeavors - encouraging the students to find the light within and use it to illuminate the world around them. IGDTUW women are doing this through their immense talent, professional aptitude, and social awareness.
            I feel honored to lead an institution that is facilitating women to realize their full potential and ace in all that they wish to pursue in life. IGDTUW graduates have topped UPSC and have held prominent government posts, they have carved a niche for themselves in this competitive industry â€” making an impact wherever they go. This has largely been made possible because of the empowering and supportive environment of IGDTIJW where everyone is encouraged to mold and become their best selves. When they graduate - they don't just step out as professionals but as leaders, enablers, changemakers - the torchbearers of our country's bright future.
            We have tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Uber, Intuit, Goldman Sachs, Adobe to name a few, visiting our campus for the placement drive. Our institute had concluded the final placement season for the 2020-21 batch by surpassing the previous year's benchmarks with 431 job offers to students from various national and international organizations. Among the packages offered, 59.5 LPA package, ranked highest which was offered by Google."
